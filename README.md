# Gravitational-Wave-Classification-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks

With the major advancements in modern technology, gravitational waves have finally been proven to exist in our Universe ever since 
Albert Einstein predicted their existence in 1916. Deep learning has also gained quite a reputation over the last 10 years due to its 
cost effectiveness and the ability to extract information from large amount of data. In this work, we demonstrated how some deep learning models 
such as EfficientNet-B0, ResNet-101, and DenseNet-121 can be used to classify gravitational wave signals from noises which are imperceptible to the naked eyes.
